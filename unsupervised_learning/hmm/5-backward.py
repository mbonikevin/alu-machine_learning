    Performs the backward algorithm for a hidden markov model.

    Args:
        Observation: numpy.ndarray of shape (T,) that contains the index of
            the observation. T is the number of observations.
        Emission: numpy.ndarray of shape (N, M) containing the emission
            probability of a specific observation given a hidden state.
            N is the number of hidden states and M the number of all possible
            observations.
        Transition: 2D numpy.ndarray of shape (N, N) containing the
            transition probabilities.
        Initial: numpy.ndarray of shape (N, 1) containing the probability of
            starting in a particular hidden state.

    Returns:
        P, B, or None, None on failure.
        P is the likelihood of the observations given the model and B is a
        numpy.ndarray of shape (N, T) containing the backward path
        probabilities.
